**Use case is nothing but the scenarios. To represent these scenarios in pictorial form we use Use Case Diagram.**
It has below components:
- **Actors** (Who interacts with System. Can be Human or any other server/ machine)
- **Use Case** (Functionalities provided by system)
- **Relation** (Relationship b/w actor and system(use case)). It is drawn using straight line.

To draw, an use case diagram, find all use cases and list them out inside system boundary.

Let's dig deep in Use case Diagram.
**Extend** (It is an optional behaviour. Base use case is complete by itself.)
**Include** (It is a mandatory behaviour. Base use case is incomplete without this.)
**Generalization** (Base UJse case is an abstract use case (Generally an abstract class). Specialized use cases are required for this.)
